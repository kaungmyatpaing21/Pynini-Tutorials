<b>Pynini</b>

OpenGrm Pynini, like Thrax, compiles grammars expressed as strings, regular expressions, and context-dependent rewrite rules into weighted finite-state transducers. It uses the OpenFst library and its Python extension to create, access and manipulate compiled grammars. Pynini is embedded in a Python module, allowing users to write Thrax-like grammars using Python's flexible syntax (including imperative programming constructs not available in Thrax) and powerful toolchain, including an interactive development ("REPL") environment.
