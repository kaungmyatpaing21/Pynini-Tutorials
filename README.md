# Pynini

OpenGrm <a href= "http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/Pynini">Pynini</a>, like <a href="http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/Thrax">Thrax</a>, compiles grammars expressed as strings, regular expressions, and context-dependent rewrite rules into weighted finite-state transducers. It uses the <a href="http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/WebHome">OpenFst library</a> and its <a href = "https://www.python.org/">Python</a> extension to create, access and manipulate compiled grammars. Pynini is embedded in a Python module, allowing users to write Thrax-like grammars using Python's flexible syntax (including imperative programming constructs not available in Thrax) and powerful toolchain, including an <a href="http://ipython.org/">interactive development</a> ("REPL") environment.
